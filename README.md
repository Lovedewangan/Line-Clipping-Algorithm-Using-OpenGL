# Line Clipping Algorithm Using OpenGL
 This interactive OpenGL application demonstrates two fundamental line clipping algorithms: Cohen-Sutherland and Liang-Barsky. The project provides a visual and interactive way to understand how these algorithms handle line clipping within defined viewport boundaries.
